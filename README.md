It's me, Jesse, doing my first game in Unity :D

This started out as doing the rollable tutorial for Unity 2019, but now I'm building on it, because it's fun!

The first level is an ice skating level where you will go with our little acorn boy friend to teach him how to ice skate.

Nothing bad happens. Only wholesome vibes.
