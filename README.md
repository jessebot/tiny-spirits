My first Unity game :)

This started out with just me doing the rollable tutorial for Unity 2019, but now I'm building on it, because it's fun!

The first level is an ice skating level where you will go with our little acorn boy to teach him how to ice skate.

Nothing bad happens. Only wholesome vibes.
